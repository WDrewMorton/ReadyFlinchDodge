Welcome to the README for this application.

The original below idea was originally discussed with Nick.

This game will be a mobile fighting game.
Either:
	1 v 1
	2 v 2

Turn based but 3 abilities at a time instead of 1

The python file game.py is more of a proof of concept for the game. 

This game will need the following before it is complete.
1) A more developed plan of actions
2) Decide on GUI framework & design
3) Integration with a mobile device & desktop
   a) Online Website and/or DB
   b) Only for local play using Device Discovery
